# User-centric-Adaptive-clustering-music-recommendation-system
A user-centric Adaptive clustering approach to address Long tail problem in music Recommendation System
Recommendation systems that use collaborative filtering, suffer from two prominent problems; the primary one is recommending an item that's new.
Since the item is new and not popular yet the advice system won’t be ready to recommend it. This is one of the most common challenges and is referred 
to as “cold-start problem”. the opposite problem arises when an item is old and not so popular now, but was popular when it came out. 
However, usually the recommendation system doesn't have access to it rating or number of plays or number of Buyers. Hence, it'll not be recommended. 
this can be also referred to as the “Long Tail” problem.
The approach here is to perform a specific type of adaptive clustering to the dataset so that long-tail items can be identified and recommended easily.
User-centric adaptive clustering is used with few enhancements which are:
i.	User Centric adaptive Clustering using KNN
ii.	User Centric adaptive Clustering using Weighted KNN
